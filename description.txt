Plotting Geodesics with the Midpoint-Search Method

The work was inspired by the various computational techniques that are used in practice to compute the geodesics of a surface. As we have learned,
computing the geodesic for some arbitrary surface usually involves solving some form of differential equation,
which calls for a variety of interesting computational algorithms in approximating values. We decided to try and plot geodesics along a curve with these methods.
The algorithm we ended up using was the midpoint-search method, which approximates the geodesic from a point headed a certain direction by drawing a straight line in a small increment initially and then using the changes in the normal,
which encodes the partial derivatives for some surface to determine the path of the geodesic iteratively. While we experimented with geodesics on the usual multivariate distributions originally,
however we decided to try plotting geodesics for arbitrary surfaces later on. This led to more interesting patterns that highlighted just how different geodesics looked for various surfaces.
Learning of the different computational approaches used in real life to approximate these geometric quantities and implementing the visualization in code was quite satisfying and fun!
